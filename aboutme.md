My name is Duong Vu, and I am a researcher/bioinformatician at the [Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute](https://wi.knaw.nl/). My research interests focus on applying AI models to fungal identification and classification, as well as identifying mycobiota from environmental and clinical samples using eDNA and studying/developing pipelines for fungal genome analyses.
