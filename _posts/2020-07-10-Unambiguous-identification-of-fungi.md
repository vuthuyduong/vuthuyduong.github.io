The identification of fungi is challenging as fungi have simple body plans with often morphologically and ecologically obscure structures, compared with plants and animals. 
In this study [Unambiguous identification of fungi: where do we stand and how accurate and precise is fungal DNA barcoding?](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43008-020-00033-z), led by 
Robert LÃ¼cking Conrad L. Schoch, we discussed accuracy, precision, and challenges of current approaches for fungal identification. 
A conceptual framework for the identification of fungi, encouraging the approach of integrative (polyphasic) taxonomy for species delimitation, i.e. the combination of genealogy (phylogeny), 
phenotype (including autecology), and reproductive biology (when feasible), was provided.
