Up and down the mountains in South Africa looking for fungi, feeling like I am an ecologist in making :). 
A heartfelt gratitude to the [Johanna Westerdijkfonds](https://stichtingjohannawesterdijkfonds.sites.uu.nl/) and the EU-funded project [Mycobiomics No. 101008129](https://twitter.com/mycobiomics?lang=en) for making my dreams a reality! Their support has been invaluable in furthering our research endeavors in this region.
