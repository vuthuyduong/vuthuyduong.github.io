Our paper [Dnabarcoder: An open-source software package for analysing and predicting DNA sequence similarity cutoffs for fungal sequence identification](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13651) is out! 
"Metabarcoding loses significant resolution and scientific explanatory power by relying on a single similarity cut-off for taxonomic assignment". 
Dnabarcoder can be used to calculate similarity cutoffs for sequence identification for different clades of fungi and other organisms. The source code of the [dnabarcoder](https://github.com/vuthuyduong/dnabarcoder) is available at my github page: [https://github.com/vuthuyduong/dnabarcoder](https://github.com/vuthuyduong/dnabarcoder).
