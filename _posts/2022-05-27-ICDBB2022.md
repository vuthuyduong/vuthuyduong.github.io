Such a great conference [ICDBB2022](https://ggbc.eu/icdbb-2022-25-27-may-2022-website-now-available/)! Thank you for providing us with the opportunity to present our newly developed tool, 
[dnabarcoder](https://github.com/vuthuyduong/dnabarcoder), 
which enables accurate identification of fungal species from environmental samples using the eDNA approach. 
This project is a collaboration between Gerard Verkleij from the Westerdijk Institute and Henrik Nilsson from the UNITE community.
