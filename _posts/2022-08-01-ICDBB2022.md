I am grateful for the opportunity to present our research at the SASSP2022 conference on fungal species identification, particularly the generation of a comprehensive barcode dataset 
as part of the DNA barcoding project at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. This extensive dataset is a significant achievement and a valuable resource for fungal biodiversity studies.
