I am so excitied to see this paper [Comparing genomic variant identification protocols for Candida auris](https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000979), led by Christina A. Cuomo and Anastasia P. Litvintseva, being published. 
With Ferry Hagen, we contributed a pipeline to this study that is available at my github: [https://github.com/vuthuyduong/SNPanalysis](https://github.com/vuthuyduong/SNPanalysis). This pipeline can be used for Illumina, PacBio, and Nanopore reads.
