This week, we had the kickoff meeting for the 'AID: Artificial Intelligence for DNA barcode identification' project, which was recently granted by 
the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). This is a joint project between the [Westerdijk Institute](https://wi.knaw.nl/) 
and [ARISE](https://www.arise-biodiversity.nl/). A short description of the project available 
the eScience Center's [research-software-directory](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/aid?fbclid=IwAR3rXExmEbWzL8B9DMOIWDWNJ6Vg7ElV6HLFVR56wPP6OJe5bVinqLqQ60E).
Please follow the project's updates at our GitHub page: [https://github.com/MycoAI](https://github.com/MycoAI).
While creating a logo for MycoAI using Generative AI, I've also created a new avatar for my GitHub page: [https://github.com/vuthuyduong](https://github.com/vuthuyduong). 
That's really me on the image, working hard on finding the best AI models for identifying fungal biodiversity :)
