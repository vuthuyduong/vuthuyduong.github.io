I am grateful for the opportunity to present our research at the [SASSP2022](https://saspp.co.za/2022-saspp-biennial-congress/) conference on fungal species identification, particularly the generation of a comprehensive barcode dataset as part of the DNA barcoding project at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. This extensive dataset is a significant achievement and a valuable resource for fungal biodiversity studies. I would like to thank the EU-funded project Mycobiomics and the Johanna Westerdijkfonds for their generous sponsorship, which made it possible for me to participate in the conference and conduct fieldwork trips in South Africa.
